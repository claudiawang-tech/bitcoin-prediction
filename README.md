# Bitcoin Prediction Project
Deep Learning Project

## Tasks

* Pre-processed historical bitcoin datasets and created a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model in Keras.
* Extracted more bitcoin data online by PyTrends and optimized the model with Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) by adding
the additional datasets and reduced the mean-square error to around 3.
* Used TensorTrade to learn a trading strategy using Reinforcement Learning and made the complete strategy work for live trading.
* Key Accomplishments: The model selected the best portfolio and earned net worth approximately $86,184.
